### Editor
    * Time Schedule Editor now saves custom time schedules to `utils/schedule.cfg` under the Add-on directory. (Cache needs to be manually reloaded with `F5` after exiting Map Editor.)
    * Changing the color sliders and pressing the preview button shows a preview of the tint on the map.
    * New dialog for entering custom schedule ID and Name. ID will be autogenerated if the user doesn't specify it, but the user is required to enter a Name.
    * Textbox to enter Add-on ID after selecting `New Scenario > New Add-on`.
